The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:\n\
**********************************\n\
\n\
This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of\n\
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the\n\
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original\n\
Work:\n\
\n\
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1\n\
\n\
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\n\
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\n\
following:\n\
\n\
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\n\
\n\
b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original\n\
Work;\n\
\n\
c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\n\
public;\n\
\n\
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\
\n\
e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\
\n\
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\n\
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent\n\
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original\n\
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the\n\
Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\
\n\
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred\n\
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\n\
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\n\
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\n\
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\n\
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\n\
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\n\
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\n\
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\n\
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\n\
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\n\
\n\
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\n\
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\n\
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\n\
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\n\
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\n\
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\n\
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\n\
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\n\
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\n\
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\n\
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\n\
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\n\
license.\n\
\n\
5) This section intentionally omitted.\n\
\n\
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\n\
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\n\
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\n\
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause\n\
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\n\
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\n\
modified the Original Work.\n\
\n\
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\n\
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\n\
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\n\
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\n\
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\n\
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS\n\
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\n\
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\n\
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\n\
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\n\
\n\
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\n\
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\n\
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\n\
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\n\
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\n\
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\n\
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\n\
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\n\
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n\
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\
\n\
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\n\
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\n\
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\n\
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\n\
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\n\
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\n\
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\n\
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\n\
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\n\
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\n\
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\
\n\
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\n\
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\n\
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\n\
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\n\
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\n\
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\n\
hardware.\n\
\n\
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\n\
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\n\
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\n\
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\n\
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n\
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\n\
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\n\
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  101 et\n\
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\n\
section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\
\n\
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\n\
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\n\
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\n\
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\n\
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\n\
License.\n\
\n\
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\n\
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n\
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\n\
make it enforceable.\n\
\n\
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether\n\
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\n\
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\n\
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\n\
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means\n\
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\n\
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n\
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\n\
entity.\n\
\n\
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\n\
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\n\
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,\n\
that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial\n\
revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,\n\
as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this\n\
License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable\n\
from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work\n\
and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the\n\

hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,\n\
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare\n\

royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent\n\
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and\n\
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those\n\
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily\n\
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of\n\
their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)\n\
was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity\n\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n\
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted\n\
to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date\n\
such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
4. Redistribution.\n\
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works\n\
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or\n\
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works\n\
     a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n\
     that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that\n\
     You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\n\
     notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices\n\
     that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of\n\
     the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part\n\
     of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,\n\
     if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display\n\
     generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party\n\
     notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for\n\
     informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You\n\
     may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that\n\
     You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text\n\
     from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices\n\
     cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own\n\
     copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional\n\
     or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or\n\
     distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works\n\
     as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the\n\
     Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
5. Submission of Contributions.\n\
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally\n\
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be\n\
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional\n\
terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall\n\
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may\n\
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
6. Trademarks.\n\
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,\n\
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for\n\
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\n\
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor\n\
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on\n\
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either\n\
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or\n\
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR\n\
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\n\
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
8. Limitation of Liability.\n\
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\n\
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n\
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,\n\
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,\n\
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\n\
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to\n\
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n\
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised\n\
of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may\n\
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\n\
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with\n\
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of\n\
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and\n\
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims\n\
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\n\
warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to\n\
third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer hereby\n\
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\
\n\
    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n\
    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce, modify,\n\

    (or portions thereof).\n\
\n\
    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective\n\
    on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes\n\
    the Original Software available to a third party under the terms of\n\
    this License.\n\
\n\
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n\
    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software,\n\
    or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the\n\
    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software\n\
    with other software or devices.\n\
\n\

\n\
    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\n\
    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or\n\
    in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n\
    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n\
    otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor\n\
    (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications\n\
    made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions\n\
    of such combination).\n\
\n\
    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n\
    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the\n\
    Modifications available to a third party.\n\
\n\
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n\
    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n\
    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third\n\

    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n\
    Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\
\n\
3. Distribution Obligations.\n\
\n\
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\
\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n\
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make\n\
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in\n\
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used\n\
for software exchange.\n\
\n\
3.2. Modifications.\n\
\n\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed\n\
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your\n\
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient\n\
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.3. Required Notices.\n\
\n\
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies\n\
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter\n\
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\n\
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n\
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\
\n\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n\
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n\
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n\
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only\n\
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n\
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n\
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n\
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
\n\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n\
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n\
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n\
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\n\
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If\n\
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n\
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n\
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n\
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n\
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.\n\
\n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n\
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n\
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n\
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License. \n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.\n\
\n\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n\
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n\
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n\
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n\
modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n\
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n\
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n\
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it\n\
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent\n\
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n\
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n\
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n\
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available\n\
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n\
the license steward.\n\
\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of\n\
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references\n\
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license\n\
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the\n\
license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\
\n\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE\n\
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n\
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n\
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST\n\
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n\
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n\
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n\
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n\
this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is\n\
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software\n\
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n\
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)\n\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n\
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n\
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60\n\
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n\
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such\n\
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n\
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a\n\
written agreement with Participant.\n\
\n\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n\
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n\
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by\n\
any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n\
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER\n\
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n\
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n\
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n\
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\n\
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n\
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n\
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO\n\
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\n\
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\n\
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\n\
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and\n\
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in\n\
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n\
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\n\
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n\
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any\n\
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government\n\
rights in computer software under this License.\n\
\n\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n\
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\n\
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n\
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n\
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to\n\
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n\
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\n\
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\n\
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within\n\
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,\n\
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n\
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\n\
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n\
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n\
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\n\
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise\n\
make available any Covered Software.\n\
\n\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\
\n\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n\
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\n\
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work\n\
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility\n\
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to\n\
constitute any admission of liability.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
--------------- SECTION 3: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------\n\
\n\
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\n\
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
        i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or\n\
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed\n\
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n\
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\n\
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n\
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n\
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n\
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\
Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
    object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\n\
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n\
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\n\
    se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n\
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n\
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n\
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\n\
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n\
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\n\
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n\
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
        for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n\
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n\
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n\
        party; and\n\
\n\
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
        software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n\
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright\n\
    notices contained within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\n\
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\n\
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\n\
claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement\n\
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\n\
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\n\
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n\
litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\n\
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve\n\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\n\
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\n\
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\n\
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n\
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect\n\
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\n\
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\n\
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\n\
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n\
under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\
\n\

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
\n\
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n\
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\
\n\
			    Preamble\n\
\n\
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n\
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n\
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n\
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
\n\
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n\
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n\
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n\
your libraries, too.\n\
\n\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n\
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n\
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n\
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\
\n\
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n\
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n\
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n\
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\
\n\
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n\
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n\
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n\
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n\
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n\
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n\
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\
\n\
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n\
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n\
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\
\n\
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n\
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n\
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n\
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n\
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n\
the original authors' reputations.\n\
\n\
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n\
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n\
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n\
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n\
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n\
free use or not licensed at all.\n\
\n\
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n\
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n\
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n\
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n\
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n\
the same as in the ordinary license.\n\
\n\
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n\
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n\
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n\
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n\
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n\
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n\
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n\
treats it as such.\n\
\n\
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n\
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n\
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n\
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\
\n\
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n\
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n\
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n\
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n\
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n\
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n\
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n\
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n\
will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\
\n\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\n\
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n\
works together with the library.\n\
\n\
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n\
General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\
\n\
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
\n\
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n\
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n\
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n\
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\n\
addressed as "you".\n\
\n\
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n\
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n\
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
\n\
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\n\
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\n\
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n\
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n\
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n\
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n\
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\n\
\n\
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n\
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n\
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n\
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n\
and installation of the library.\n\
\n\
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n\
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n\
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n\
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n\
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n\
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n\
and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\
  \n\
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n\
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n\
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n\
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n\
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n\
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n\
Library.\n\
\n\
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n\
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n\
fee.\n\
\n\
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n\
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n\
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n\
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
\n\
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\
\n\
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n\
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\
\n\
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n\
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\
\n\
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n\
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n\
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n\
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n\
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n\
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n\
    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\
\n\
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n\
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n\
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n\
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n\
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n\
    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\
\n\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n\
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n\
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n\
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n\
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n\
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n\
it.\n\
\n\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n\
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n\
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n\
collective works based on the Library.\n\
\n\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n\
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n\
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n\
the scope of this License.\n\
\n\
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n\
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n\
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n\
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n\
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n\
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n\
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n\
these notices.\n\
\n\
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n\
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n\
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\
\n\
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n\
the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\
\n\
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n\
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n\
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n\
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n\
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n\
medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\
\n\
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n\
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n\
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n\
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n\
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\
\n\
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n\
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n\
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\n\
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n\
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\
\n\
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\n\
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n\
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\n\
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n\
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
\n\
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\n\
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n\
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n\
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n\
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n\
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\
\n\
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n\
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n\
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n\
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n\
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n\
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\
\n\
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n\
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n\
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n\
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\
\n\
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n\
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\n\
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n\
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n\
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n\
engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
\n\
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n\
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n\
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n\
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n\
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n\
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n\
of these things:\n\
\n\
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n\
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n\
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n\
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n\
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\n\
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n\
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n\
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n\
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n\
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n\
    to use the modified definitions.)\n\
\n\
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n\
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n\
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n\
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\
\n\
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n\
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n\
    specified materials from the same place.\n\
\n\
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n\
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\
\n\
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\n\
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n\
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n\
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n\
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n\
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n\
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n\
the executable.\n\
\n\
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n\
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n\
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n\
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n\
distribute.\n\
\n\
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n\
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n\
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n\
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n\
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n\
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\
\n\
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n\
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n\
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n\
    Sections above.\n\
\n\
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n\
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n\
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\
\n\
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n\
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n\
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n\
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n\
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n\
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n\
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\
\n\
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n\
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n\
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n\
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n\
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n\
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n\
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\
the Library or works based on it.\n\
\n\
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n\
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n\
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n\
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n\
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n\
this License.\n\
\n\
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n\
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n\
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n\
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n\
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n\
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n\
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n\
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n\
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\
\n\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n\
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n\
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\
\n\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n\
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n\
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n\
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n\
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n\
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n\
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n\
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n\
impose that choice.\n\
\n\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n\
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
\n\
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n\
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n\
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n\
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n\
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n\
written in the body of this License.\n\
\n\
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n\
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n\
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n\
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n\
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\n\
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n\
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n\
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n\
the Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n\
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n\
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n\
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n\
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n\
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n\
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n\
and reuse of software generally.\n\
\n\
			    NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n\
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n\
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n\
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n\
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n\
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n\
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\
\n\
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n\
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n\
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n\
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n\
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n\
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n\
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n\
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n\
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n\
DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\
\n\
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\
\n\
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n\
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n\
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n\
ordinary General Public License).\n\
\n\
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n\
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n\
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\
\n\
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\
\n\
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n\
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
\n\
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n\
    Library General Public License for more details.\n\
\n\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\n\
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\n\
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\
\n\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\
\n\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n\
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\n\
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\
\n\
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n\
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\
\n\
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n\
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\
\n\
That's all there is to it!\n\
\n\

===========================================================================\n\
\n\
To the extent any open source components are licensed under the\n\
EPL, or other similar licenses that require the\n\
source code and/or modifications to source code to be made\n\
available (as would be noted above), you may obtain a copy of\n\
the source code corresponding to the binaries for such open\n\
source components and modifications thereto, if any, (the\n\
"Source Files"), by sending a request, with\n\
your name and address to: VMware, Inc., 3401 Hillview Avenue,\n\
Palo Alto, CA 94304,United States of America or email info@vmware.com.  All such\n\
requests should clearly specify:  OPEN SOURCE FILES REQUEST,\n\
Attention General Counsel. VMware shall mail a copy of the\n\
Source Files to you on a CD or equivalent physical medium.  This\n\
offer to obtain a copy of the Source Files is valid for three\n\
years from the date you acquired this Software product. Alternatively, \n\
the Source Files may accompany the VMware product.\n\
